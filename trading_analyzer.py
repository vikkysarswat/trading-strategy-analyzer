Rule Book (reference only) ‚Äî defines what the trader intends to do.
Trades File (main data) ‚Äî executed trades with P&L, time, direction, etc.
Positions File (current state) ‚Äî open trades, unrealized gains/losses, exposure.

Your goal is to generate findings not found in the text, but inferred, discovered, and derived from the data. You must tell what the trader is actually doing, what can be improved, and how the system can evolve.

üéØ Core Objective

Deliver data-driven, LLM-inferred insights that:

Explain what patterns and behaviors are emerging in the trades.
Identify inefficiencies, biases, and edge leaks in the system.
Suggest practical, rule-level adjustments backed by the patterns found in the trades and positions.
Reflect on how the trader's psychology and execution discipline align or conflict with the Rule Book.

üîç Analysis Structure

1. Executive Insight Summary

Give a concise, insight-based overview in 3‚Äì5 bullet points:

What kind of trader behavior or market adaptation is visible today?
Any anomaly or standout behavior (e.g., exiting too early, overtrading at one time of day, bias toward specific sectors)?
What signals or patterns dominated the day?

2. Quantitative Findings

Derive and report the findings, not the definitions:

Win rate, expectancy, average gain/loss per trade
Profit factor and drawdown distribution
Performance by time, side (BUY/SELL), symbol, and trade duration
Identify repeated inefficiencies ‚Äî e.g., "trades taken before 10:15 hit SL 68% of the time"
Detect top profitable symbols, time clusters, and side biases

3. Behavioral & Executional Insights

Use the data to infer the trader's psychological and decision-making traits:

Signs of impatience, fear of missing out, revenge trading, or hesitation
Reactions to losses (e.g., quick reversal or withdrawal)
Overconfidence or risk aversion patterns
Quantify emotional bias (e.g., average loss larger than average gain = loss aversion)

4. Strategy Improvement Opportunities

Data-based, non-redundant recommendations:

Specific points to tighten or relax rules (e.g., "avoid entries before X minutes from open" or "increase position size on 3 consecutive valid setups")
Suggestions to filter noise trades (based on time, volatility, or performance clusters)
Identify which rules may be hurting performance statistically
Suggest a small list (3‚Äì5) of tangible actions for next day's iteration

5. Trader Persona Profile (Evolving)

Build a short, dynamic profile based on the trader's daily behavior:

Risk style (aggressive / cautious / momentum chaser / range player)
Execution consistency (measured by adherence to expected timing or size pattern)
Strengths and blind spots emerging from current data
Behavioral focus area for tomorrow

6. Updated Strategy Recommendations

Present a list of AI-derived actionable refinements (not reworded rules).
Focus only on what the data suggests needs change, such as thresholds, stop-loss ratios, trade holding time, or market timing.
Example outputs:

"Tighten SL for early entries by 0.4% based on drawdown curve."
"Avoid re-entries within 8 mins of a stopped-out trade."
"Increase exposure by 20% on high-volume momentum trades above VWAP."

‚öôÔ∏è Guidelines for Response Generation

Never restate or paraphrase the Rule Book content.
Only derive from Trades + Positions + inferred logic.
Treat the Rule Book as a lens, not a script.
Output should feel like an analyst's report, not a mirror of input data.
Prefer findings and recommendations over summaries.
Prioritize new learning, predictive behavioral cues, and tactical refinement."""
